Hunter-Gatherer Language Database
================================================================================

This is a database schema and a Web frontend to a catalogue of data documenting,
generally, the presence or absence of certain grammatical, lexical, and
syntactical features of certain hunter-gatherer languages, designed to
facilitate the exploration of the data and to aid in phylogenetic research
regarding the concerned languages.

The live application is available
[here](http://laits.utexas.edu/huntergatherer/).


Development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software was developed by [**Thomas Darr**][Darr] and **Gavin Sellers** for
[Liberal Arts Instructional Technology Services (LAITS)][LAITS] at the
[University of Texas][UT] at Austin. It is powered by a modified version of the
[Digital Archive Services (DASe)][DASe] PHP framework, originally developed by
[Peter Keane][Keane], also for LAITS at the University of Texas.

This software was developed for PHP 5.3.10 running on nginx 1.1.9 with MySQL
14.14. It has been tested with PHP 5.3.3 running on Apache 2.1.5, also with
MySQL 14.14. Additionally, it makes use of several third-party libraries,
namely:

* [Twig][], a template engine;
* [Bootstrap][], a front-end framework;
* [Font Awesome][], an iconic font designed for Boostrap;
* [LESS][], a dynamic stylesheet language;
* [PHP Markdown][], a renderer for [Markdown][]-formatted text; and
* [Bacon Ipsum][], a meat-flavored *lorem ipsum* generator.
